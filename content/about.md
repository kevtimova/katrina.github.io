title: "About Me"

I hold a PhD from NYU's Center for Data Science, where I was advised by Yann LeCun. My research explores self-supervised learning methods for extracting meaningful representations of images, videos, and other modalities, with a focus on regularization techniques that prevent model collapse during pre-training.
