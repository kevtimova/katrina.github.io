title: "About Me"
---

I have a PhD from NYU's Center for Data Science, where I was advised by Yann LeCun. My research focuses on self-supervised learning methods for extracting meaningful representations from images and videos. In particular, I develop regularization techniques that prevent  collapse during model pre-training, ensuring that the learned representations remain informative and useful.

Beyond my doctoral work, I am excited about advancing large language models and multi-modal generative systems. Drawing from my research experience, I am interested in evaluating and building more robust and scalable AI systems that generalize effectively across diverse tasks.
